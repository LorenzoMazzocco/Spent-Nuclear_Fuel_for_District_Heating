This work aims to produce a model to reproduce steady-state working conditions for the IRIS's Emergency Heat Removal System test facility at SIET laboratories in Piacenza (IT).
The main source of information for the project was the experimental work produced by Santini et al. presented in this [paper](https://github.com/LorenzoMazzocco/INE-Modelling-Projects/files/7887818/EHRS.pdf).

The main results of this project are presented in this [report](https://github.com/LorenzoMazzocco/INE-Modelling-Projects/files/7887825/Project_Work___Introduction_to_Nuclear_Engineering___Passive_Safety_System.6.pdf).

The raw data resulting from the 236 simulations performed is stored in this [file](output_model.mat).
