## Spent Nuclear Fuel for District Heating
This repository contains a work in progress paper on the possibility of using spent nuclear fuel assemblies from LWRs as a heat source for a district heating system.

The original idea was to engineer a system in which the fuel assemblies are cooled by an inert gas. 
After a review of the safety criteria for fuel bundles in dry storage in became clear that for economic and safety reasons the system as originally thought did not make sense. 

Nevertheless a 30 page review of the safety criteria and a brief presentation of the concept were produced. The review is the SNF_DH.pdf file.
